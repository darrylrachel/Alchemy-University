# Blockchain & Crypto

## Purpose of Blockchain
- The purpose of a blockchain is to have a __network of computers agree upon a common state of data__
- __No person or organization should be able to control this process__
- Blockchain lets you decentralize where code runs and agree on the output
  - There is no single owner of the code's execution (developers can choose to write privileged code)
    - The code always runs as programmed
    - The code is transparently verifiable

### How does it work (Bitcoin)
  - Proof of Work - Security
  - Mining Rewards - Financial Incentives
  - Public Key Cryptography - Authentication
  - Linked Data Structure - Chronology
  - Peer to Peer Network - Permissionless

  These components work together in unison, decentralization emerges from a properly setup network.

## Crypto
- Before cryptocurrency, there was crypto (1970's)
- Two important primitives for our purposes:
  - Cryptographic Hashes
    - __Has functions__
      - Hash: Give me some input, big or small and I'll give you a fixed size output
      - Input can be any data type (string, number, image, video, etc.)
    - Two important use cases for Hash functions are
      1. Commitments (Protocol & Smart Contract)
      2. Proof of Work

  - Public Key Cryptography
